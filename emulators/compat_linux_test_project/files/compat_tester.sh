NAME
	compat_linux_test_project - package to run LTP tests on NetBSD

SYNOPSIS
	compat_linux_test_project [options]

DESCRIPTION
	compat_linux_test_project is a package to download, build, and run
	the Linux Test Project (LTP) test suite on NetBSD, intended for
	testing	the compat_linux compatibility layer.

	It automates fetching, building, and executing LTP tests, helping
	to identify missing syscalls, behavioral differences, and other
	issues in NetBSD's Linux compatibility subsystem.

	If no --syscall option is passed, the default behavior is to test
	every possible syscall. This uses the LTP runtest/syscalls file to
	determine what to test and in which order. This means that the syscall
	name cannot be correctly-determined sometimes, resulting in suboptimal
	output in the logs. This also takes some time and is not
	recommended, except in some niche cases.

	All tests belong to Linux Testing Project, this package only ports
	them to	make them run on NetBSD. Support the Linux Test Project by
	checking their official website:
		https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp

OPTIONS
	-d, --output-dir output_dir

		Directory where output is written.
		In test-run mode (default): new logs are stored here,
		overwriting any older logs already there.
		In comparison mode (-c): the categorized comparison results
		(compared_logs/) are stored here instead.

	-s, --syscall syscall1[,syscall2,...]
		A comma-separated list of which syscalls to test.
		The script will search for them using the LTP runtest file,
		so the name may be slightly different from the syscall name
		(though this is unusual).

		WARNING: some syscalls are excluded from the default (full)
		run because they are known to cause problems (e.g. kernel
		panics or hangs, see check_for_testcase_issue() in the
		script). If you explicitly list one of these syscalls here,
		the script will still run it, but will print a warning first.

	-r, --reproducible
		Sets the LTP environment variable LTP_REPRODUCIBLE_OUTPUT to 1.
		According to LTP documentation, this "suppress printing TINFO
		and TDEBUG messages and discards the actual content of the
		other messages printed by the test (suitable for a
		reproducible output)."

		This flag should be set if the logs are meant to be compared.

	-c, --compare logs_dir
		Compares logs_dir agains a baseline, highlighting
		their differences. For a consistent comparison, both
		sets of logs should have been gathered using the
		'reproducible' mode ('-r' flag).

		The baseline defaults to the reference logs shipped with the
		package, or to whatever is passed via '-b'.

		If '-s' is also passed, the comparison is restricted to the
		syscalls listed there.

		The comparison is done as follows:
		Checks for tests that are new, tests that are no longer
		present, and tests whose result changed. Changed results are
		further split into regressions (e.g. PASS -> FAIL), fixes
		(e.g. FAIL -> PASS) and	other changes (e.g. shift in skipped
		or warnings). Some testcases are known to depend on
		functionalities with no equivalent in NetBSD and are marked
		as wont_test.

		Each category is stored in its own subdirectory, mirroring the
		syscall/testcase layout of the compared logs:
			compared_logs/
			|-- changed/
			|-- fixed/
			|-- new/
			|-- regressed/
			|-- removed/
			|   |-- syscall_a/
			|       |- testcase01.log
			|-- wont_test/

		Each generated testcase01.log file is self-contained:
		- For 'new'/'removed' testcases, it has a short status line
		  followed by the full content of the one log that exists
		  (current or reference, respectively).
		- For 'changed'/'fixed'/'regressed' testcases, it has the
		  reference and current pass/failed/broken/skipped/warnings
		  counts, followed by the full content of both the reference
		  and the current log.
		This means you normally do not need to go dig through the
		original sys_logs/ or reference logs directories to
		investigate a specific result; everything relevant is already
		copied into diff_logs/.

		The comparison assumes the testcases output follows the
		standard and new LTP strucuture. This is not true for every
		testcase, in this case, the comparison has undefined
		behaviour.

	-b, --baseline logs_dir
		Directory with the logs to use as baseline. Only meaningful
		together with '-c'. Defaults to the reference logs shipped
		with the package.

	--fail-on-regression
		Only meaningful together with -c.
		When this flag is set, the script exits with a non-zero status
		if any test is found in compared_logs/regressed/. This is
		intended for use by automated testing.
		Has no effect without -c.

	-h, --help
		Shows this message
